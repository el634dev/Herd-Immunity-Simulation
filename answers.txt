1) What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
Population Size: 10
Percent Vaccinated: 0.1
Virus Name: Sniffles
Mortality Rate: 2
Repro Rate: 10
2) What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
80%
3) What percentage of the population died from the virus?
.2 or 20%
